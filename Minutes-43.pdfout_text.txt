Resolutions to accept, budget, and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

Section 42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards
of education can access income which becomes available to them
after they have adopted a final budget. When such added income 1s
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use, the
adoption of the resolution to accept, budget, and spend the income 1s
a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations in the
amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of that
income for the purposes designated in the resolution and supporting
budget. The following items represent such resolutions for the
