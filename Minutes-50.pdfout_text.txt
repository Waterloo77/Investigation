Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that

included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code Sectio

routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations in the amount
of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of that income for
the purposes designated in the resolution and supporting budget. The
