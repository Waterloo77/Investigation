CONSENT ITEMS Approve and adopt
revised Consent
Action by the Board of Education in "Adoption of Consent Calendar.

in this section are adopted by one single motion unless a Member of
the Board or the Superintendent request that any such 1tem be
removed from the "consent calendar" and voted upon separately.
Generally, "consent calendar" items are matters which Members of
the Board and the Superintendent concur are routine in nature and
should be acted upon in one motion to conserve time and permit
focus on other-than-routine matters on this agenda.

Prior to the vote on the above, items D2al, D3z, D5h, D5), D7d,
D7e, D1 lh, D1 1t, D11z, and Dllcc, were removed from the
Consent Calendar; item D6a, case no. 368-01 placement changed to
Sojourner Truth and the suspended expulsion term until Fall 2001
