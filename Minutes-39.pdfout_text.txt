Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

after they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is

available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use, the

adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the income is
a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations in the

income for the purposes designated in the resolution and supporting
budget. The following items represent such resolutions for the
