Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Received from the Year Round Operational Federal grant for

the operational expenses at Year Round school sites.

ADMINISTRATION--Finance

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

(Fund A3) $26,985
Received from the Year Round Operational Federal grant for

ADMINISTRATION--Finance

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Received from the Year Round Operational Federal grant for

the operational expenses at Year Round school sites.

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

ADMINISTRATION--Finance

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

ADMINISTRATION--Finance

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Received from the Year Round Operational Federal grant for

the operational expenses at Year Round school sites.

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Received from the Year Round Operational Federal grant for

the operational expenses at Year Round school sites.

ADMINISTRATION--Finance

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

ADMINISTRATION--Finance

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Received from the Year Round Operational Federal grant for

the operational expenses at Year Round school sites.

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

ADMINISTRATION--Finance

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Received from the Year Round Operational Federal grant for

the operational expenses at Year Round school sites.

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Received from the Year Round Operational Federal grant for

the operational expenses at Year Round school sites.

ADMINISTRATION--Finance

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

(Fund A3) $26,985
Received from the Year Round Operational Federal grant for

the operational expenses at Year Round school sites.

ADMINISTRATION--Finance

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Received from the Year Round Operational Federal grant for

the operational expenses at Year Round school sites.

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

ADMINISTRATION--Finance

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Received from the Year Round Operational Federal grant for

the operational expenses at Year Round school sites.

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

Received from the Year Round Operational Federal grant for

the operational expenses at Year Round school sites.

ADMINISTRATION--Finance

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated

below:

GENERAL FUND, Long Range Facilities Process

(Fund A3) $26,985
Received from the Year Round Operational Federal grant for

the operational expenses at Year Round school sites.
