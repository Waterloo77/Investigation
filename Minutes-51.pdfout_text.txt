Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of
education can access income which becomes available to them after
they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use, the
adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the income is a
routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations in the amount
of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of that income for
the purposes designated in the resolution and supporting budget. The
following items represent such resolutions for the purposes stated
below:

GENERAL FUND, School in the Park Program Rosa Parks
