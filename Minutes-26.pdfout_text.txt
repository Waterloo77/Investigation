of the Board or the Superintendent request that any such item be
removed from the "consent calendar" and voted upon separately.
Generally, "consent calendar" items are matters which Members of
the Board and the Superintendent concur are routine in nature and
should be acted upon in one motion to conserve time and permit
focus on other-than-routine matters on this agenda.

Prior to the vote on the above, item D6j, was removed from the
agenda; items D1, October 10, 2000 minutes, D3c, D3al, through
D3al2, D4b, and D5c were removed from the Consent Calendar;

Resolutions to accept, budget and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

42602. These resolutions provide the means by which boards of

education can access income which becomes available to them after

they have adopted a final budget. When such added income is
available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to its use,
the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget and spend the

income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of

that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions
for the purposes stated below:
