Resolutions to accept, budget, and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

Section 42602. These resolutions provide the means by which the
board of education can access income which becomes available to
them after they have adopted a final budget. When such added
income 1s available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to

its use, the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget, and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations in

the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following items represent such resolutions for
the purposes stated

below:
