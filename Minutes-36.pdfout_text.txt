Resolutions to accept, budget, and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

Section 42602. These resolutions provide the means by which
boards of education can access income which becomes available to
them after they have adopted a final budget. When such added
income 1s available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to
its use, the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget, and spend
the income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted
appropriations in the amount of the added income and authorizes the
expenditure of that income for the purposes designated in the
resolution and supporting budget. The following items represent
such resolutions for the purposes stated below:
