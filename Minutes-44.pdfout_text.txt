CONSENT ITEMS

Action by the Board of Education in "Adoption of Consent Calendar"
at this point of the agenda means that all items appearing in this
section (Section D.) are adopted by one single motion unless a
Member of the Board or the Superintendent request that any such
item be removed from the "consent calendar" and voted upon
separately. Generally, "consent calendar" items are matters which
Members of the Board and the Superintendent concur are routine in
nature and should be acted upon in one motion to conserve time and
permit focus on other-than-routine matters on this agenda.

Member Zimmerman was out of the room during the vote on the
above item.

Prior to the vote on the Consent Calendar, at item D5a, student
discipline, Case nos. 02-0408 and 02-0529 were withdrawn; Case

Resolutions to accept, budget, and spend income, in excess of that
included in the adopted budget, are authorized by Education Code

Section 42602. These resolutions provide the means by which
boards of education can access income which becomes available to
them after they have adopted a final budget. When such added
income 1s available and a majority of the board is in agreement as to
its use, the adoption of the resolution to accept, budget, and spend the
income is a routine action. It increases the budgeted appropriations
in the amount of the added income and authorizes the expenditure of
that income for the purposes designated in the resolution and
supporting budget. The following ttems represent such resolutions for
