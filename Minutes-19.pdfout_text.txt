revised Consent
Action by the Board of Education in "Adoption of Consent Calendar.

Calendar" at this point of the agenda means that all items appearing
in this section are adopted by one single motion unless a Member
of the Board or the Superintendent request that any such item be
removed from the "consent calendar" and voted upon separately.
Generally, "consent calendar" items are matters which Members of
the Board and the Superintendent concur are routine in nature and
should be acted upon in one motion to conserve time and permit
focus on other-than-routine matters on this agenda.

removed from the Consent Calendar, item D7b was removed from
the agenda, and a public hearing was heard regarding item D4a.
