CONSENT ITEMS

Approve and adopt
revised Consent
Calendar.

Action by the Board of Education in "Adoption of Consent
Calendar" at this point of the agenda means that all items
appearing in this section are adopted by one single motion unless a
Member of the Board or the Superintendent request that any such
item be removed from the "consent calendar" and voted upon
separately. Generally, "consent calendar" items are matters which
Members of the Board and the Superintendent concur are routine
in nature and should be acted upon in one motion to conserve time
and permit focus on other-than-routine matters on this agenda.

Prior to the vote on the above, item D7d was removed from the
agenda; items D3e and D6u were removed from the Consent
Calendar; items D3c and DSd were discussed prior to the vote on
